## Install Python

EyeTrackVR is currently using [Python 3.11.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) Before you continue, please install it.

## Installing Poetry

Starting with version `0.1.7`, EyeTrackVR uses Poetry to manage app dependencies. To build the app, you must first install Poetry to fetch the required dependencies.

To install Poetry open Windows Powershell and run the following command `(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -`

[Poetry Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

## Install the required Python modules

After cloning the project and installing Poetry, open a command prompt in the EyeTrackApp folder. Then run the command: `poetry install`

This should install all of the required modules.

## Build the app

Now, you should be ready to build the app.
With a command prompt open in the EyeTrackApp folder, run the command `poetry run pyinstaller eyetrackapp.spec`

Give it time to build the app. Once done, the app should be under `dist/eyetrackapp`
