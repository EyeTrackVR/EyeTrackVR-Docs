# 3D Printed Mounts {.text-[var(--font-accent)]}


Mounts with a `â˜…` next to them are the recommended mounts for the respected hmd. This is based on user feedback on what works best for most people.


<Alerts :options="alerts.parts_list_three">
    <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
        Keep in mind, some mounts only have the right(or left) version available. You will need to use blender or any slicer to mirror an STL for the other side. 
        </p>
    </template>
