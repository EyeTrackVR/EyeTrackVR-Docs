        The <a class="custom-links" href="/intro" target="_blank">guides</a> on this website include some of our team's own notes (not all of them are polished) that we disclose for other people to use.<br>
        <br>
        Here, we hope you may find something useful to you.<br>
        <br>
        We advocate the <a class="custom-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model" target="_blank">Open Source model</a>.<br>
        <br>
        This is why we strive to make our work open to other people for consultation, replication and reuse.
