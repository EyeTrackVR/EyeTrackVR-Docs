## About IR Emitter Safety

Please *exercise caution* when messing around with IR emitters.

IR can be dangerous to your eyes once at a certain power level. It is not recommended to use different emitters unless you know exactly what you are doing as it could result in harm to your eyes.
If you doubt yourself, just do exactly what we do. Don't use different emitters, don't use different means of power, etc.

::: danger
It is important that you <ins>**DO NOT BYPASS (OR NOT DO) ANY SAFETY FEATURES PUT IN PLACE**</ins>. This can result in irreversible bodily harm.
:::

The safety measures were put in place to REDUCE the potential failure risk. All further safety responsibilities are on the user. This includes visually checking with an IR camera that the brightness is correct and that you do not feel warmth or experience short-term effects after being exposed to the IR light (symptoms such as dark spots or dry/warm feeling eyes while actively using). While we strive to make EyeTrackVR as safe as possible, we do not hold any responsibility for damage done.

        <p>
            Make sure you are using <ins class="text-red-400 dark:text-red-500">non-focused</ins> emitters and no more than <ins class="font-bold">5 mW/sr</ins> total power.

## Hardware

Please check out our [parts list](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/how_to_build/parts_list) and [hardware repo.](https://github.com/EyeTrackVR/EyeTrackVR-Hardware) for information regarding hardware.

## Firmware

Our firmware called OpenIris is made by `lorow` found [here](https://github.com/lorow/OpenIris).

## Headset support

In theory, we are compatible with every VR headset. However, mounts may not have been made yet.
Please take a look at our list of [3d printable mounts](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/how_to_build/parts_list#_3d-printed-mounts) and see if your headset is on the list.
If it is not listed, It is recommended that you try to make a mount, or wait for a skilled community member to create one.

#### Contact

Please join our discord for updates and any questions. We hope to see you there!
