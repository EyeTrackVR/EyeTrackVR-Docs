            question: "How will this work?",
            answer: "Currently, a camera is mounted inside the headset for each eye. The camera streams through wifi to a PC client which processes and sends eye tracking data to an OSC endpoint ex VRChat.",

            question: "What features will be supported?",
            answer: "The goal is eye tracking with eye openness, and some form of pupil dilation. A far away aspiration of this project is some form of weak foveated rendering because it's cool and any small performance increase in VR is welcome.",
