# Things To Know Before You Start {.text-[var(--font-accent)]}

## This page is an overview of things to know and understand before you start this project

### Software is not final

Bugs can and will occur which may hinder the experience or usability at times.
Do not expect 100% reliable and perfect function. Not all features are fully developed yet.

### Firmware may have user difficulties

As our firmware matures, bugs may creep up that make the process not flawless.

### IR emitters can be dangerous

If handled wrong or precautions are ignored you can and will cause damage to your eyes. Please make sure to only buy linked emitters at calculated power or ones with specs that match exactly. We will not be responsible for damage caused if you go your own route. Our official kits are designed to be well within safety limits when used as designed.

### Documentation may be incomplete

Important steps may be missing or unclear. We are working to bring documentation to completeness but it is a large undertaking and takes time. Feel free to ask questions in our Discord if things are unclear.

### Once you have acknowledged the items above, move on to the [Full Build Guide](../how_to_build/full_build)
