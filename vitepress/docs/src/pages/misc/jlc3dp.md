### Upload your STL files with the following print settings
Do note that if you are printing for a example, a lens mount, you may need to mirror it in blender, or any slicer, to get both a left and right STL and upload them separate. Do not upload them combined

In the likely event you get an [email or alert](https://i.imgur.com/t2QmpBY.png) from JLC asking for consent to print as the STL has thin walls, you can agree to the print without worry.
