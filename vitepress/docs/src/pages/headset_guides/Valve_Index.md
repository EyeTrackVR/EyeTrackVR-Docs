<!-- ![HMD](https://i.imgur.com/Q3OoLkJ.jpeg) !-->

#### Mod Details
The DEV Frunk is a popular choice for ETVR on the Index. Replacing the original index frunk entirely, it has multiple mounting points for both the XIAO's, a Vive Facial Tracker (or [babble!](https://www.printables.com/model/745299-xiao-sense-case-seeed-studio-xiao-esp32s3-sense-ca)), and cutouts for 30x30x7mm fans.  
It also provides excellent ventilation simply due to the design being much more open, as well as a flip up design for the face tracker mount.

#### Extra Parts Needed:
I recommend a screw kit like [this](https://www.amazon.com/XOOL-Precision-Screwdriver-Extension-Smartphone/dp/B086SQZGLJ) one
- 1x T5 Torx Screwdriver
- 1x H4.0 Screwdriver
- 1x Soldering Iron for heat inserts
- 8x M4x8.1 Heat Inserts [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256804349544912.html)  Choose Size: M4 (OD 6mm)50pcs | Color: Length 8mm
- 6x M4x10 Screws [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2251832624557792.htm) Choose Size: M4 20pcs | Length: 10mm

#### 3D Printed Mounts
Found at MUTEtheCyberwolf's [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MUTEtheCyberwolf/VALVE-INDEX-DEV-Frunk-1.0/tree/main/3D%20Print%20Files%20STL(Ascii))

You will need to print:
- 1x Coverplate for XIAO Retention Clip (Logo or no Logo)
- 1x Eyetrack VR Prototype XIAO Mount.stl
- 1x FacialTrackerBeerHingeVIDEVFrunk1.stl
- 1x FacialTrackerBridgeVIDEVFrunk1.stl
  - Alternatively, if you have the [LDLRUI USB HUB](https://www.amazon.com/LDLrui-4-Port-Splitter-Multiport-Adapter/dp/B0BLHCD7FS), [this modified version](https://github.com/Frosty704/mods-eyetrackvr/blob/main/ldlrui%20case%20and%20bridge%20merged-FacialTrackerBridgeVIDEVFrunk1.stl) of the DEV Frunk Bridge by Frosty can snap fit the hub onto the bridge. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/kRvx56r.jpeg)
- 1x ValveIndexDEVFrunk1.stl
  - Alternatively, if you are interested in routing the ribbon cables internally, [this modified DEV Frunk](https://github.com/Frosty704/mods-eyetrackvr/blob/main/ValveIndexDEVFrunk1_MODIFIED.stl) has holes at the top for sliding through ribbon cables and power cables. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/RcYQ8xd.png)
- 1x XIAO Retention Clip (Letters or no Letters)


Lens insert support Yes/No: Yes [Compatable mount](https://github.com)
::: info Note
There are 160 and 130-degree variants for camera mounts; pick which one corresponds with your cameras.

#### Assembly Details:
Start with inserting your heat inserts to the designated holes on the frunk. Place the heat inserts so the side with the smaller radius sits in the hole 

  - When heating up the inserts, **let the weight of the soldering iron do the work**, they make take a few seconds to start moving on their own.
  -  **Do not push down**, and remove the iron when they are level with the print. It doesn't need to be perfect, so take your time!

Next, place a heat insert into the bigger hole of the facial tracker bridge

Lastly, place another heat insert into the thick side of the beer hinge

Now you're done with the hardest part!
We can move onto screwing in the XIAO Mount and Facial tracker bridge onto the frunk, into the heat inserts we just inserted.
  - The XIAO mount should be placed so the longer side is not blocking the fan holes
  - If you have trouble screwing them in, try screwing them equally to distribute the pressure more evenly.
    - Screw one a little, screw the opposite the same amount, repeat.

Two last things to screw in will be the beer hinge and vive facial tracker or babble case if you have it

Place the smaller hole of the beer hinge inbetween the bridge's screw holes. 
Make sure the beer hinge isn't flipped, it should have the larger hole on the same side of the bridge's heat insert
  - Screw in **opposite** of where the heat insert is. You should be screwing ***into*** the heat insert

For the last screw, repeat the same steps, but line up your face tracker or babble case. Screw from the same direction, into the heat insert of the beer hinge.
Use either an M4x10 or an M4x30. I find the M4x10 sometimes loses tension, while the M4x30 doesnt. 

Your final result should look like this

You must have a Torx screwdriver set to remove the frunk screw, do so now.

Then attach part b and tighten:
