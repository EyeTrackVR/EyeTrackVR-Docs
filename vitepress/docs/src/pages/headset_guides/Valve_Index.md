![DevFrunk1](https://i.imgur.com/KQDFg1J.jpeg)

#### Mod Details
The DEV Frunk is a popular choice for ETVR on the Index. It has multiple mounting points for both the XIAO's, a Vive Facial Tracker (or [babble!](https://www.printables.com/model/745299-xiao-sense-case-seeed-studio-xiao-esp32s3-sense-ca)), and cutouts for 30x30x7mm fans.  
It also provides excellent ventilation simply due to the design being much more open.

#### Extra Parts Needed:
