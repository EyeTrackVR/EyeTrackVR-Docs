# What are "Headset Specific Guides"?

This is an initiative to provide specific information on specific headsets. Any weird quirks, recommended 3d printed mounts and different setup types are to be included on a page. 

Complete submissions will receive a 20% off coupon for the ETVR store. Partial completions (one specific mount) will receive 15% off coupons to show our appreciation and provide an incentive. (reach out to me in dms to receive the code `@prohurtz`)  

Thank you for working to improve EyeTrackVR's accessibility!  


### Guidelines

Please keep it as concise as possible, and spell check before submitting. You can submit by making a PR on github, or sending the `.md` file to #documentation in the ETVR Discord pringing `@prohurtz` .


file name: `headset_name.md`
ex. `HTC_Vive_Pro_2.md`, `Bigscreen_Beyond.md`
