<!-- ![HMD](https://i.imgur.com/Q3OoLkJ.jpeg) !-->

#### Mod Details
The DEV Frunk is a popular choice for ETVR on the Index. Replacing the original index frunk entirely, it has multiple mounting points for both the XIAO's, a Vive Facial Tracker (or [babble!](https://www.printables.com/model/745299-xiao-sense-case-seeed-studio-xiao-esp32s3-sense-ca)), and cutouts for 30x30x7mm fans.  
It also provides excellent ventilation simply due to the design being much more open, as well as a flip up design for the face tracker mount.

#### Extra Parts Needed:
I recommend a screw kit like [this](https://www.amazon.com/XOOL-Precision-Screwdriver-Extension-Smartphone/dp/B086SQZGLJ) one
- 1x T5 Torx Screwdriver
- 1x H4.0 Screwdriver
