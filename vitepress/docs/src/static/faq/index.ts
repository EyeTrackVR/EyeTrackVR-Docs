            question: "How does this work?",
            answer: "Currently, a camera is mounted inside the headset for each eye. The camera streams through WiFi or USB to a PC client which processes and sends eye tracking data to an OSC endpoint ex VRChat.",

            answer: "The goal is eye tracking with eye openness, pupil dilation and more ready to go with little user config. A slightly further aspiration of this project is some form of foveated rendering because it's cool and any small performance increase in VR is welcome.",
