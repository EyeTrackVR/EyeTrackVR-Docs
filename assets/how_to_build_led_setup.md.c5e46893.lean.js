There are a few specific caveats to know before assembling and using this hardware.</p><ol><li><p>The board must be supplied with 5v.</p><ul><li>Other voltages may result in darker/non functioning LEDs.</li></ul></li><li><p>You must change resistors if you change from a single or dual eye setup to the other.</p><ul><li>Not doing so will result in too dim of LEDs or extremely bright LEDs. Ensure you are always using the correct one for your application.</li></ul></li><li><p>Shorts on the main board can result in damaged hardware, dangerously bright LEDs, or nonfunctioning hardware.</p><ul><li>Please ensure there are no shorts (even very small stray solder strands) between any pins or solder joints on the main board or LEDs.</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id="wiring-up-v4-lite" tabindex="-1">Wiring up V4 Lite <a class="header-anchor" href="#wiring-up-v4-lite" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Wiring up V4 Lite&quot;">​</a></h2><p>First, decide if you want dual eye or single eye operation and pick the appropiate resistor.</p><p><strong><strong>Single Eye:</strong></strong><br> Use the 130ohm resistor marked with Black, Black, and Gold middle rings:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dCNMQaZ.jpeg" alt="v4litesingleeye"></p><p><strong><strong>Dual Eye:</strong></strong><br> Use the 65ohm resistor marked with Yellow, White and Gold middle rings:</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vuhsckU.jpeg" alt="v4litedualeye"></p><p>Now, solder the resistor on the board (any orientation), and then the black 3 pin voltage regulator (orientation matters, solder on the side with the white outline and have it fit in the outline&#39;s shape)</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/s1eqJiE.jpeg" alt="v4litemainboardassem"></p><p>Now, wire up the LEDs like shown.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l57tEmr.png" alt="v4litefullassmb"></p>',37)]))}const u=t(o,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,u as default};
