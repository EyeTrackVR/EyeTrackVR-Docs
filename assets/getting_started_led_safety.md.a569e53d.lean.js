It is not recommended to use different emitters unless you know exactly what you are doing as it could result in harm to your eyes. If you doubt yourself or do not understand something, just do exactly what we do. Don&#39;t use different emitters, don&#39;t use different means of power, etc.</p><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">DANGER</p><p>It is important that you <ins><strong>DO NOT BYPASS (OR NOT DO) ANY SAFETY FEATURES PUT IN PLACE</strong></ins>. This can result in irreversible bodily harm.</p></div><p>The safety measures were put in place to REDUCE the potential failure risk. All further safety responsibilities are on the user. This includes visually checking with an IR camera that the brightness is correct and that you do not feel warmth, excessive eye-strain or experience short-term effects after being exposed to the IR light (symptoms such as dark spots or dry/warm feeling eyes while actively using). While we strive to make EyeTrackVR as safe as possible, we do not hold any responsibility for damage done.</p><h3 id="what-we-care-about" tabindex="-1">What we care about: <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-care-about" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What we care about:&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We care about power exposure &quot;W&quot; to the cornea, which we can normalize over the exposed area to Irradiance &quot;mW/cm^2&quot; This number gives us the amount of IR radiation being released into the normalized area. We don&#39;t really care about &quot;mA&quot;, or &quot;V&quot; alone, as by themselves these do not give us the exposure levels which we need to ensure safety.</p><p>Irradiance also needs to take into account distance of the light source (LED) as the further away you get from a source the weaker the intensity gets. (You can test this by looking at a light source from far away, and as you move closer, the brighter and more painful it is to look at) We do this by using Radiance &quot;mW/cm2/sr&quot; to normalize for the distance. The &#39;sr&#39; stands for steradian, which can be thought of as a cone shape expanding as it moves away from the source.</p><p>The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection&#39;s <a href="../safety/ICNIRP_optical_radiation.pdf">Guidelines of limits of exposure to broad-band incoherent optical radiation (0.38 to 3 µm)</a> states:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;To avoid thermal injury of the cornea and possible delayed effects on the lens of the eye (cataractogenesis), infrared radiation (780nm &lt; &gt; λ &lt; &gt; 3μm) should be limited to 100 W m⁻² (10 mW cm⁻²) for lengthy exposures (&gt; 1000 s)&quot;</p></blockquote><p>So 10 mW/cm2 is the <strong>max</strong> recommended limit given by this source. In my opinion this is still quite high, you will definitely feel some warmth and likely eyestrain after a while.</p><p>It is known that when outside and not directly looking at the sun, your eyes get exposed to about 1 mW/cm2 or IR radiation.
