It is not recommended to use different emitters unless you know exactly what you are doing as it could result in harm to your eyes. If you doubt yourself, just do exactly what we do. Don&#39;t use different emitters, dont use differnt means of power, etc.</p><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">DANGER</p><p>It is important that you <ins><strong>DO NOT BYPASS (OR NOT DO) ANY SAFETY FEATURES PUT IN PLACE</strong></ins>. This can result in irreversible bodily harm.</p></div><p>The safety measures were put in place to REDUCE the potential failure risk. All further safety responsibilities are on the user. This includes visually checking with an IR camera that the brightness is correct and that you do not feel warmth or experience short-term effects after being exposed to the IR light (symptoms such as dark spots or dry/warm feeling eyes while actively using).
