The camera streams through wifi to a PC client which processes and sends eye tracking data to an OSC endpoint ex VRChat.",hyper_link:"",link_description:""},{question:"What features will be supported?",answer:"The goal is eye tracking with eye openness, and some form of pupil dilation. A far away aspiration of this project is some form of weak foveated rendering because it's cool and any small performance increase in VR is welcome.",hyper_link:"",link_description:""},{question:"When will this be completed?",answer:"When it's done 😉 I have a semi busy life so development may slow and speed up inconsistently.",hyper_link:"",link_description:""},{question:"Will IR damage my eyes?",answer:"This project has safety in mind.
