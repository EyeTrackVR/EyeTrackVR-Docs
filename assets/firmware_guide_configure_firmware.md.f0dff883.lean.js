This will allow you to connect to the ESPs using the following format: <code>http://&lt;some_name&gt;.local</code>.

Then, you will need to set the <code>otapassword</code> to the password you wish to use to update the firmware. You will need to use this password to update the firmware. If you do not wish to use a password, you can set the <code>otapassword</code> to nothing. This will allow you to update the firmware without a password. However, this is not recommended, as anyone on your network will be able to update the firmware.</p><p>You will also need to set the <code>otaserverip</code> to the IP address of the ESP you wish to update. This is the IP address of the ESP you wish to update. If you are using mDNS, you can use the mDNS name of the ESP you wish to update. For example, if you are updating the ESP with the dns set to <code>http://esp32.local</code>, you will need to set the <code>otaserverip</code> to <code>http://esp32.local</code>.</p><h4 id="rest-api" tabindex="-1"><code>REST API</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#rest-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;`REST API`&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The firmware also supports a fully featured REST API.
