Here I will show some simple steps to get some form of a mount working.</p><h2 id="step-1-find-a-way-to-mount-to-your-headset-s-lens" tabindex="-1">Step 1: Find a way to mount to your headset&#39;s lens <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-1-find-a-way-to-mount-to-your-headset-s-lens" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Step 1: Find a way to mount to your headset&#39;s lens&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The easiest way to get started is to find a lens protector for your headset. You can visit a website like <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Thingiverse</a> or do a search for &quot;3d printed lens protector for {your headset here}&quot;</p><p>Example: Here is a lens protector for the Quest 1/2 and Rift S <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3653631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3653631</a></p><h2 id="step-2-find-a-camera-mount" tabindex="-1">Step 2: Find a camera mount <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-2-find-a-camera-mount" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Step 2: Find a camera mount&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, you need a way to attach the camera. We have a basic design created by qdot, based on his mount on the hardware GitHub <a href="https://github.com/EyeTrackVR/EyeTrackVR-Hardware/blob/main/3d_Printed_Mounts/Basic_Mount_Components/basic_ETVR_camera_mount.stl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can create your own mount if you have the skills.</p><h2 id="step-3-place-the-camera-mount-where-it-will-give-a-good-camera-angle" tabindex="-1">Step 3: Place the camera mount where it will give a good camera angle <a class="header-anchor" href="#step-3-place-the-camera-mount-where-it-will-give-a-good-camera-angle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Step 3: Place the camera mount where it will give a good camera angle&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The &quot;Ideal&quot; location is a place that gives a good view of the pupil when looking to all extremes, the lower corners do a good job at getting there, or nearly there.</p><p>It is recommended to place the camera as close as possible to the headset&#39;s lens to maximize the view of the eye.
