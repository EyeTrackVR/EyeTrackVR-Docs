This is useful if you do not know the IP address of the device, or if you do not want to keep track of the IP address of the device. This is also useful if you are using a device that does not have a static IP address.</p><p>In the <code>mDNS</code> protocol the IP address of the device can change, but the name of the device will always be the same. This means that you can connect to the device using the name of the device, even if the IP address of the device changes.</p><p>The name of the device is the name of the device followed by <code>.local</code>. For example, if the name of the device is <code>esp32</code>, you can connect to the device using <code>http://esp32.local</code>.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-it" tabindex="-1">How to use it <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-use-it" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="enable-mdns" tabindex="-1">Enable mDNS <a class="header-anchor" href="#enable-mdns" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The <code>mDNS</code> is enabled by default on the new firmware, and can not be disabled.</p><p>To use it,all you need to do is set the name of the device in the <code>platformio.ini</code> file.</p><p>This setting can be located under the <code>[wifi]</code> section of the <code>platformio.ini</code> file.</p><div class="language-ini line-numbers-mode"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">ini</span><pre class="shiki material-palenight"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F07178;">mdnsname</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">=</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">openiristracker</span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#676E95;font-style:italic;"># do not add .local</span></span>
